      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I'm a former cook changing careers.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Lake County, IL</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Reading, writing music and poetry, playing bass, cooking, and combat sports</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>How limited has our collective imagination become that so many of our dreams are only different ways of selling our labor, or exploiting the labor of others.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Illinois.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>My previous career became a serious detriment to my health, and I rarely had health insurance. Also, I find the work interesting and I've long thought of, and mentioned often, becoming a developer.</p>
